For more simpler terms, this mod makes it so that you have 10% chance to die when encountering fear and you must be with someone (if you're playing alone than it just would just work by only having the 10% chance to die) also a 13% chance to tremble in fear meaning you move slower for 2.5 seconds as if you were frozen in fear. So, make sure your employee does not get scared a lot otherwise you may just have a heart attack.
